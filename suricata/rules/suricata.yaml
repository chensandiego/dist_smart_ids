outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular
      filename: eve.json
      # The path below is relative to the Suricata working directory.
      # In our Docker setup, this will be /var/log/suricata/
      # So the full path will be /var/log/suricata/eve.json
      # This matches the path expected by suricata_alert_parser.py
      # You can adjust this path if needed.
      # For example, if you want to output to a different directory,
      # make sure to update the volume mount in docker-compose.yml
      # and the path in suricata_alert_parser.py accordingly.
